Investment versus Speculation
=============================

What is the difference between making an investment or making a speculation?

    *An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.*

These determinations are contradictory of the definition above:

    1. Only bonds should be bought for investments
    2. All stocks are speculative (w.r.t 1929-1932 market plumet)
    3. An ``investor`` is anyone who participates in the stock market

There is distinction between investment and speculation in common stock.
- there is ``inherent risk`` in purchasing common-stock that is inextricable from the ``potential profit``

    - ``inherent risk`` and ``potential profit`` are two variables considered by an investor
    - **there is no common-stock investment policy that will prevent significant losses**

    - when investing remember this ``intrinsic risk`` is a speculative factor
    - the goal is to bound speculative factors within minor allowable limits

        - and to be prepared financially and psychologically for the worst case

What is stock speculation?

    - not criminal, not unethical, usually not profitable
    - unintelligent speculation is:

        1. speculating when you think you are investing
        2. speculating seriously when you don't have the knowledge or skill
        3. risk money that you can't afford to lose in a speculative gamble

    - nonprofessionals can not make intelligent use of credit - their attempts are at best speculative when they invest borrowed captial
    - can create a speculative account but don't put money in the account becuase a common-stock or the market is improving

Results to be Expected by the Defnsive Investor
===============================================

- defensive investor primarily desires safety and low-maintenance
- **what return can he expect under "average normal conditions"** (if such a circumstance even exists)

Will address what the investor can expect by:
1. a legacy point of view, from (7) years ago
2. changes in the factors driving an investor's expectable return from (7) years ago
3. what to do and what to expect present day (in early 1972)

What They Said Six Years Ago (1964)
-----------------------------------

- divide portfolio between high-grade bonds and leading common stocks

    - 75% >= bonds >= 25%, and converse for common stock

    POLICIY I. (General Policy):
    - simplest is 50-50 split, with adjustmenets to rebalance after the market has perturbed the portfolio by as much as 5%

    POLICY II. (Market @ Dangerous High):
    - 75% bond, 25% common-stock

    POLICY III. (Market @ Extreme Low):
    - 25% bond, 75% common-stock

What was the return from bond and stock?

    BOND RETURN

        - 4.5% on high-grade taxable bonds
        - 3.25% on good tax-free bonds

    COMMON-STOCK RETURN (Dow Jones Industrial Average @ 892)

        - 3.2% for leading common stocks
        - should only be able to expect initial dividend return between 3.5% and 4.5% on stock purchases
        - stock appreciation + divdend is ~7.5% growth per year

    - A portfolio with 50/50 split would yield ~6% before income tax
        - stock part of portfolio guards against loss of purchasing power from a large degree of inflation
    - the numbers above indicate a lower yield than found between 1949-1964
        - on average yield was >= 10% for stocks
        - this surge shouldn't be interpreted as a bright future, but rather an alarm and omen of ill-portent, surely the market will contract

What Happened Since 1964
------------------------

- the big change from 1964 (presently 1972) is the interest rates of first-grade bonds to unprecedented highs

    - there was a drop in 1970
    - some good corporate issue bonds are around 7.5%
    
        - compared to the 4.5% of 1964

    - dividend is 3.5% versus 3.2% (in 1964)
    - change in interest rates had a max decline of 38% in the market price of medium-term (~20 yr) bonds since 1964

- in 1964 discussed stock price may be to high and a big decline might be immenent; this seems to also be true for bonds as suggested by 1964-1972. Caused by interest rates.

    - **bonds can vary significantly in price due to changes in interest rates**

- **true "cash equivalents" were better investments in 1964 than common stock**

    - even though inflation normally means stocks are a better choice than cash
    - the decline in quoted principal of good longer-term bonds was because of changes in the money market
    - generally bonds fluctuate much less than stock prices, any investors can buy good bonds of any maturity without having to worry about changes in their market value

Expectations and Policy in Late 1971 and Early 1972
---------------------------------------------------

- end of 1971 8% taxable interest on good medium-term corporate bands
- end of 1971 5.7% tax-free on good state or municipal securities
- shorter-term there were 6% on U.S government issues due in five years
- 1971 3.5% return from the DJIA @ 900

QUESTION: how to didvide the fund beteween high-grade bonds (i.e "cash equivalents") and leading DJIA-type stocks?

    - What to do if we know for certain bonds/stock surely will decline/rise?

    We know:

        - defensive investor can depend on 3.5% dividend return on stock and a average annual appreciation ~4%

            - based on reinvestment by various companies of a corresponding amount annually out of undistributed profits

            - before-tax combined return of stock would average 7.5%
            - after-tax combined average ~5.3%
            
            - this is the same as medium-term bonds or less than high-grade bonds.

            - stocks much less favourable than than in 1964

            - interest and principal payments on good bonds are better protected than dividens and price appreciation stocks

    Therefore bond investments (@ 1972) are more preferable to stock investment - due to the yield relantionship of bonds > the stock yield and inflation at the moment isn't deteriorating the yield of the bond.

        - the critique that inflation will counteract the yield of bonds can be disputed with analysis of American historical inflation

            - there is the possibility of accelerated inflation
            - american businesses becomse so profitable, without inflation, to justify large increase in common-stock; however there would no longer be yield differential and the circumstance is moot.
            - hysteria causes common-stock prices to rise
